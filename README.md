# Road Accident Analysis Using Excel
# Data Overview
In this Excel dashboard project, we'll use a dataset containing information about road accidents. Our goal is to create a visual, user-friendly dashboard that summarizes accident details, severity, weather conditions, and more. This dashboard will provide quick insights for informed decision-making and analysis.

# Data Cleaning
We've ensured data accuracy by removing duplicate entries from the dataset. To enhance data analysis, we've also created a "Month" and "Year" column from the "Accident Date" data, allowing for easy filtering and visualization based on these temporal dimensions. This data transformation ensures that the dashboard provides more meaningful insights and simplifies data exploration for users.

# Pivot Tables and Visualizations
Utilized pivot tables to analyze data and build the dashboard. Created visualizations, including KPIs, charts and graphs, to represent key insights from the dataset.

# Building the Dashboard
Constructed an interactive dashboard using pivot tables and visualizations. Customized the layout, appearance, and formatting of the dashboard to enhance user experience.

# Buttons, Filters and Slicers
In this Excel dashboard project, we've incorporated Buttons, Filters, and Slicers to enhance user interaction. Users can now explore specific data subsets with ease. Filters based on Accident Date, Urban, and Rural areas have been added, enabling users to refine their data views. Additionally, interactive buttons have been included to provide users with dynamic features, making the dashboard more engaging and user-friendly.
